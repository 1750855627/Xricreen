/**
  Introduction

  LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core,
  scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in
  multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

  The LZ4 compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions.
  Compression can be done in:
    - a single step (described as Simple Functions)
    - a single step, reusing a context (described in Advanced Functions)
    - unbounded multiple steps (described as Streaming compression)

  lz4.h provides block compression functions. It gives full buffer control to user.
  Decompressing an lz4-compressed block also requires metadata (such as compressed size).
  Each application is free to encode such metadata in whichever way it wants.

  An additional format, called LZ4 frame specification (doc/lz4_Frame_format.md),
  take care of encoding standard metadata alongside LZ4-compressed blocks.
  If your application requires interoperability, it's recommended to use it.
  A library is provided to take care of it, see lz4frame.h.
